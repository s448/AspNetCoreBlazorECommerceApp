Joyce Carol Oates has described it as \"Dostoevsky's most confused and violent novel, and his most satisfactorily 'tragic' work.\"[1] According to Ronald Hingley, it is Dostoevsky's \"greatest onslaught on Nihilism\", and \"one of humanity's most impressive achievements—perhaps even its supreme achievement—in the art of prose fiction",
